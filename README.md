# GitHub Dependency and Collaboration Visualizer

This fullstack web application visualizes two aspects of a GitHub repository:

- Internal file/module dependencies (based on import statements)
- Contributor collaboration networks (based on pull request reviews)

Users can enter any public GitHub repository (e.g., `vercel/next.js`) and view an animated, interactive graph of either type. The project is optimized for interactivity, modern frontend development, and portfolio visibility.

## Features

### Code Dependency Graph

- Parses `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `.go`, `.py` files
- Detects internal imports using regex-based parsing
- Renders dependency graphs using React Flow and Dagre layout
- Clickable nodes link directly to files on GitHub
- Includes zoom, pan, minimap toggle, fullscreen mode, and dark mode

### Contributor Graph

- Displays pull request author-reviewer relationships as a directed graph
- Custom contributor nodes show avatar and username
- Contributor data retrieved from GitHubâ€™s GraphQL API
- Switch between code and contributor views instantly with animated transitions
