## What It Does

Enter any public GitHub repository (e.g., `vercel/next.js`) and visualize:

- Internal file and module dependencies  
  (based on import, require, or include statements)

- Contributor collaboration networks  
  (based on pull request review interactions)

## Features

### Code Dependency Graph

- Parses `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `.go`, `.py` files
- Detects internal imports using lightweight regex parsing
- Graph layout powered by React Flow and Dagre
- Clickable nodes open the corresponding GitHub source file
- Zoom, pan, minimap, fullscreen, and dark mode support

### Contributor Network Graph

- Displays pull request author-reviewer relationships
- Contributor nodes include GitHub avatars and usernames
- Uses GitHubâ€™s GraphQL API for contributor data
- Animated toggle between dependency and contributor views
